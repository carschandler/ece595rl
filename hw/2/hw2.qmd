## Problem 1

## Problem 2

## Problem 3

## Problem 4

First, we need to assign labels to the states, which are the different spaces on the board. We will use a zero-indexed $x$-$y$ coordinate system to refer to the different states $s_{xy} \in \mathcal{S}$, with the origin at the bottom left square, $s_{0,0}$. Moving horizontally will increase the $x$-component and vertically the $y$-component, so that our state space is 

$$
\mathcal{S} =\{s_{ij} : i, j \in \mathbb{N}_{0}, \quad i,j \le 5 \}
$$

Note that although we are using two "dimensions" to identify each state, we still treat it as a one-dimensional vector, so that we have one row for each $s \in \mathcal{S}$ in $\vec{v}$, $P^{\pi}$, and so forth.
### 4.1.a
The policy can be evaluated analytically using the following equation:

$$
\vec{v}^{\pi} = (I - \gamma P^{\pi})^{-1} \vec{R}^{\pi}
$$

We have $\gamma = 0.95$ from the problem statement. $P^{\pi}$ and $\vec{R}^{\pi}$ each need to be evaluated by going over each state in $\mathcal{S}$ and using the information given to us to evaluate them. Beginning with $\vec{R}^{\pi}$:

$$
\vec{R}^{\pi} = \begin{bmatrix}
R(s_{1,1}, \pi(s_{1,1}) \\
R(s_{1,2}, \pi(s_{1,2}) \\
\cdots \\
R(s_{4,4}, \pi(s_{4,4}))
\end{bmatrix}_{|\mathcal{S}| \times 1}
$$
