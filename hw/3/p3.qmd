## Problem 3

First, we define the trajectories given, and after this we apply the every-visit
Monte Carlo method to estimate $Q^\pi(b, x)$ based on the collected sample
trajectories:

```{python}
{{< include p3.py >}}
```

The resulting $\hat{Q}^\pi$ is shown above, and we can see that

$$
Q^\pi(b, x) \approx \hat{Q}^\pi(b, x) = `{python} qhat[(State.b, Action.x)]`
$$
